This project is to design a AVL tree to mange the UFID and corresponding name
it allow the preorder, inorder and posterorder traversal in the balanced binary tree
each node could only hold one name but could store different UFID if the name repeat but won;t allow any repeat UFID.
it also can print the UFID by the name and by level traverlsal too
